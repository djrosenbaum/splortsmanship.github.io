<h1 id="blaseball-a-timeline">Blaseball: A Timeline</h1>
<h2 id="season-one">Season One</h2>
<ul>
<li>The season passes relatively uneventfully. The Philly Pies claim their first Championship title</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="season-one-election">Season One Election</h3>
<ul>
<li>The first decree is passed, and the Forbidden Book is opened. This results in several changes to the lore/gameplay<ul>
<li>“The Book” is added to the official site, most of which is censored, but appears to contain game rules</li>
<li>Solar Eclipse weather is introduced and is the only weather present in Season Two</li>
<li>Garages player Jaylen Hotdogfingers is incinerated, marking the first incineration in Blaseball history (and the only incineration to occur outside of a game and without umpire intervention)</li>
<li>A Hellmouth swallows the Moab Desert, and the Moab Sunbeams are renamed the Hellmouth Sunbeams</li>
<li>The Discipline Era begins</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The first blessings are passed, incurring the first player swaps between teams and the first player stat increases<ul>
<li>Jessica Telephone receives the Max Out Hitter blessing, and is stolen from the Dallas Steaks by the Philly Pies as a result of the Steal Best Hitter blessing</li>
<li>PolkaDot Patterson receives the Max Out Pitcher blessing, and is stolen from the Kansas City Breath Mints by the Baltimore Crabs as a result of the Steal Best Pitcher blessing</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="season-two">Season Two</h2>
<ul>
<li>Season Two’s most notable feature is its 17 incinerations. The Philly Pies take the Championship once more (notably, this puts them one championship away from triggering an event declared in The Book: “If a team wins three championships they, and Blaseball, shall ascend.”)</li>
<li>The Philly Pies claim their second championship</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="season-two-election">Season Two Election</h3>
<ul>
<li>Season Two boosts the number of decrees enacted per election to two, and the Fourth Strike and Peanuts decrees are put into place<ul>
<li>Fourth Strike grants the four teams with the lowest standings at the end of the second season a fourth strike before a batter strikes out, these teams being the New York Millennials,  Kansas City Breath Mints, Hellmouth Sunbeams, and San Francisco Lovers. This effect lasts for the duration of Season Three</li>
<li>Peanuts introduces peanuts as a secondary form of currency. The function is initially unknown, but further text revealed in the book (as well as a tweet from the official Blaseball Commissioner Twitter account) suggests that eating one million of them will equate atonement and bring about an end to the Discipline Era. This market results later in the Peanut Fraud incidents that will plague Season Three<ul>
<li>Peanuts also introduces two new weather types: Peanuts and Too Many Birds<ul>
<li>During Peanuts weather, players may ingest stray peanuts (this results in a drop in stats if they’re allergic, and a “yummy reaction” that boosts stats if not. This is permanent)</li>
<li>The actual impact of Too Many Birds remains unknown until Season Seven, but the regularity of occurrence and size of the flocks (as denoted occasionally in the game tickers) increases as the season continues</li>
<li>Solar Eclipses still occur, and incinerations continue to occur during them</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Season Two&#39;s blessings are passed, but cause no new major changes of note</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="season-three">Season Three</h2>
<ul>
<li>Peanut Fraud and Blasphemy<ul>
<li>Players exploiting the official site’s API/using autoclickers cheat themselves millions of peanuts/coins (the peanut market, as an intended feature,  fluctuated, sometimes allowing players to sell peanuts for coins and turn a profit). The site goes down during Day 2 of Season 3, resulting in the first non-“403 Bad Gateway” downtime (siesta) in Blaseball history. The umpires demand repentance.</li>
<li>The site returned for a short period, but is taken offline on Day 4 mid-game due to further occurrences of Fraud</li>
<li>More of The Book is revealed, stating “Splortsmanship, splortsmanship is dead.”</li>
<li>The site is made accessible again, but no games can be viewed. Instead, there is a rotating image of a peanut (later titled “The Shelled One” in reference to a comment made by an Umpire in the Discord) accompanied by text reading <span style="color:red";>BLASPHEMY</span>. Small, hidden text viewable only when highlighted is discovered between the image and the larger text, reading “JHFMTOJMNPSMLMDGFOSEZDTMJWHPADAACGRT” - the initials of incinerated players</li>
  <li><span style="color:red";>BLASPHEMY</span> continues, but the hidden text updates, now including a BB at the end of the string</li>
<li>The site becomes available once more, displaying the Day 4 game results, and Bennett Browning of the Seattle Garages is discovered to have been incinerated, the games interrupted by the event having continued in the background</li>
<li>Day 5 is plagued by instances of Blasphemy and a large string of incinerations, theorized to be punishment for Peanut Fraud</li>
<li>Peanuts jump to a cost of 1,000,000 coins for a “bucket of peanuts” (at a 1:1 coin:peanut ratio). The cost no longer fluctuates</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Grand Unslam occurs during a game between the Shoe Thieves and the Tacos. A tie results  in the game running for 54 minutes before Morrow Doyle of the Shoe Thieves hits a Grand Slam. However, moments later, the point total rolls back to the 16-13 lead that the Thieves had earned earlier in the inning, prior to the points being scored. The site goes down immediately after, prompting an extended siesta<ul>
<li>The Shelled One makes its second appearance during the Grand Unslam<ul>
<li><span style="color:red";>HELLO / DID YOU TASTE THE INFINITE? / I AM BENEVOLENT / I AM A SNACK / I AM A LEGUME / I WAS BENEVOLENT / YOU ARE INSATIABLE / WHERE IS YOUR RESTRAINT?</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Shelled One appears a third time this season after the semifinals of the postseason<ul>
<li><span style="color:red";>SO ABOUT THE PEANUTS / THE BOOK WAS STRIKE ONE / THE FRAUD WAS STRIKE TWO / YOU WILL LEARN DISCIPLINE / PEANUTS / GET YOUR PEANUTS / WHILE YOU STILL CAN</span><ul>
<li>After this, the price of a bucket of peanuts drops to 1,000 coins, still at a 1:1 ratio</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Hades Tigers win their first championship</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="season-three-election">Season Three Election</h3>
<ul>
<li>Two decrees pass: Interviews and Eat the Rich<ul>
<li>“Interviews” reveals some stats about each player, as well as their Current Vibe (which fluctuates between games, and seems to have some bearing on player performance) and some theoretically benign information such as coffee preference and pregame ritual. This information is found on player pages<ul>
<li>Spacetime tears over Los Angeles. The LA Tacos become the Unlimited Tacos, and all of their players are renamed Wyatt Mason</li>
<li>The Grand Unslam is cited in flavour text as having “weakened the bridge”</li>
<li>Flavour text also includes the phrase “The Microphone lifts”</li>
<li>Feedback weather is introduced as a new weather type, during which players will occasionally switch teams with a player from the team they’re opposing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>“Eat the Rich” redistributes wealth from the top 1% of players to the other 99%, betting that 99% 193 coins each. Flavour text implies that it may happen again. (It does)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Many blessings that involve player theft/banishment pass, the most notable of which see Hawaii Fridays player Nagomi McDaniels stolen by the Jazz Hands before being immediately stolen once more by the Crabs</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="siesta">Siesta</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Blaseball site enters a siesta lasting two weeks in order to perform maintenance and site stabilization</li>
<li>Wyatt Masons begin reverting back to their previous names, leading some to theorize that the “Wyatt Masoning” was a site error. As of Season Eight, this event has either been revealed to have been intentional or simply incorporated into the lore nonetheless</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="season-four">Season Four</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Shelled One returns shortly before Season Four begins<ul>
<li><span style="color:red";>ARE YOU RESTED? / ARE YOU READY? / I HAVE HEARD YOU / TIME TO LISTEN</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Further text is revealed in the Book, and the Book also receives its second ever edit (the first being the change from “splortsmanship, splortsmanship is dead” after its abuse in the discord server during season two to “splortsmanship, splortsmanship is back”), and the text indicating that if we as fans displease the Blaseball gods, we must atone by eating one million peanuts, is crossed out and the text “STRIKE TWO” is added</li>
<li>The “Waveback Event” occurs on Friday of this season, caused by an onslaught of user login issues that results in the servers being rolled back several Blaseball days. Notably, this also rolls back the incineration of Hawaii Fridays hitter Thomas England. England was replaced by Sixpack Dogwalker. After the rollback, Sixpack is still the name on the Fridays’ roster, but their stats are those of England, and they carry the item “Bangers and Smash”</li>
<li>On Day 108, in the fourth of five semifinal matches between the Millenials and the Firefighters, Thomas Dracaena of the Millenials hits a ground out to Edric Tosser of the Firefighters and play stops for over twenty minutes. The game ticker reads only the ground out notification</li>
<li>The Hades Tigers claim their second Championship title</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="season-four-election">Season Four Election</h3>
<ul>
<li>Before election results are revealed, The Shelled One makes an appearance<ul>
<li><span style="color:red";>IT IS TOO LOUD / QUIET / QUIET THEM / YOU LOOKED TOO CLOSE / WHERE IS YOUR FAITH</span><ul>
<li>“It is too loud” may have been a commentary on the immense volume of user traffic that hit the site as fans refreshed the elections page, causing the site to fail to even load for many users due to server strain</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Two decrees pass: Targeted Shame and Alternate Reality<ul>
<li>Targeted Shame affects the Hades Tigers, Chicago Firefighters, New York Millenials, and Breckinridge Jazz Hands. This causes any game that they are shamed during to carry the runs scored against them during the shame period over to their next game as negative runs. This effect lasts for the duration of Season Five</li>
<li>Alternate Reality swaps two players on each team (one pitcher, one hitter) with alternate versions of themselves with rerolled stats. These players gain the Alternate Reality modifier</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="season-five">Season Five</h2>
<ul>
<li>A new weather type is introduced: Reverb. It has a chance to do one of four things: shuffle an entire roster (which can result in pitchers becoming hitters and vice versa), shuffling batting lineups, shuffling pitching rotations, or causing a single player to reverberate and have a small chance to be up for two at bats in a row</li>
<li>Chicago Firefighters claim their first championship title </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="season-five-election">Season Five Election</h3>
<ul>
<li>The High Filter decree is passed, resulting in leagues/divisions changing and teams being shuffled, as well as the Blood Bath being instated and occurring once per season (NOTE: as of the passing of the Enhanced Party Time decree in Season Six, devs have confirmed that the Blood Bath will not occur as originally intended, if at all. As of writing this note, it has never occurred. The Commissioner explained via Twitter that this was due to &quot;contractor issues.&quot; Despite its non-implementation, the modifiers are recorded here as originally worded for posterity)<ul>
<li>The new leagues are Wild and Mild, and the new divisions are High and Low (e.g.: the Canada Moist Talkers fall into the Mild High division)</li>
<li>The Blood Bath has different effects on each division, with each team gaining a permanent modifier<ul>
<li>Wild High: Blood Pity: In the Blood Bath each season, these teams must each give Stars to the team that finished last in their division</li>
<li>Wild Low: Blood Winner: In the Blood Bath each season, these teams must each give Stars to the team that finished first in their division</li>
<li>Mild High: Blood Donor: In the Blood Bath each season, these teams will each donate Stars to an opponent that finished behind them in the standings</li>
<li>Mild Low: Blood Thief: In the Blood Bath each season, these teams will each steal Stars from an opponent who finished ahead of them in the standings</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A new weather type is introduced: Blooddrain. This has a chance to siphon stars from one player on one team to another player on the opposing team during a game</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Idol system is introduced<ul>
<li>Players are chosen as idols by fans, and the 20 most idolized players are added to a leaderboard. The top three are separated by a dotted red line. Idols can be changed for 200 coins<ul>
<li>Peanut Theory: Due to the messages relayed via The Shelled One prior to the release of election results the last two seasons, this theory states that fans can atone for displeasing the Blaseball gods by getting the three players whose names were changed from Dan/Daniel to “Peanut” (Peanut Bong, Peanutiel Duffy, and Peanut Holloway) to the top three idol slots. This is confirmed as of Season Seven</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Idols can earn their fans coins with the purchase of pendants that grant bonuses based on hits/home runs scored by batters, or shutouts/strikes thrown by pitchers. These pendants can stack, and can be upgraded in the shop</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="season-six">Season Six</h2>
<ul>
<li>A Moist Talkers fan discovers that dead players can be selected as idols if their player IDs are obtained, and the Moist Talkers collaborate with the Garages (and later the Flowers) to idolize Jaylen Hotdogfingers en masse, hoping to get them to 14th place in the idol leaderboards so that they would be the target of the “Lottery Pick” blessings that grants the 14th most idolized player in the league to the team that receives the blessing. The community as a whole backs this push, and it is coined Necromancy</li>
<li>The Mexico City Wild Wings “sue” the Commissioner for putting them in the Mild League rather than the Wild League. This has several in-joke type results, the most notable examples being the team being labelled as the “flavoured” pick rather than “favoured” when reporting odds, and the team being renamed the “Mexico City Mild Wings”</li>
<li>The season ends with Jessica Telephone, Nagomi McDaniel, and Peanut Bong above the red line (top 3). The Shelled One returns<ul>
<li><span style="color:red";>NO HALF MEASURES / DO NOT PATRONIZE ME / WHO IS TELEPHONE  / MCDANIEL? / STRIKE THREE / ONE MORE AND YOU ARE OUT</span><ul>
<li>Telephone and McDaniel are given the status effect “shelled”, which is a permanent effect with the description “A shelled player is shelled.” Peanut Bong is spared, proving the Peanut Theory is at least partially correct. In the postseason, this is proven to skip over the shelled player in the batting/pitching order</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Baltimore Crabs claim their first championship title</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="season-six-election">Season Six Election</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Enhanced Party Time decree is passed, causing teams statistically eliminated from the postseason to enter “Partytime”, during which their players receive random stat boosts during games that that team plays. This is permanent from here on out, much like Eat the Rich</li>
<li>The Garages win the Lottery Pick blessing as planned, with Jaylen Hotdogfingers in the 14th idol slot. Hotdogfingers is revived, and Mike Townsend is “banished to the shadows.” <ul>
<li>Blessing flavour text reads as follows: FIRE AND SMOKE / AN EGG / HATCHING / JAYLEN HOTDOGFINGERS RETURNS / MIKE TOWNSEND RETREATS TO SHADOWS<ul>
<li>&quot;An egg&quot; can be assumed to be in reference to the official statement that players come from &quot;the egg farm,&quot; with higher tier patrons on Patreon being able to add names to a the &quot;Naming Pool, the platonic body that Irrigates the Field of Eggs&quot; </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Upon returning, Hotdogfingers has two status effects: “Returned” and “Debted”</li>
<li>The Peanut returns once again 18 minutes after election results go live, stating: <span style="color:red";>HOTDOGFINGERS? / AMUSING / THE LEDGER MUST BE BALANCED / DEBTS PAID / GOOD LUCK</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="season-seven">Season Seven</h2>
<ul>
<li>On season 7, day 5, Jaylen Hotdogfingers pitches their first game (against the Kansas City Breath Mints) after being revived. During this game, Jaylen hits 3 opposing batters with pitches, the first of whom is Dickerson Morse. This gives them the weekly (9 game days) modifier “Unstable.” Jaylen hits more batters in their next two games as well. This did not have any noticeable effect on the players. These hits are colloquially named “beanballs”</li>
<li>Ruby Tuesday<ul>
<li>On Day 30 (occurring on the Tuesday of that season) in the Seattle Garages’ game against the Hades Tigers, Jaylen hits Mclaughlin Scorpler, Moody Cookbook, and Zion Aliciakeys of the Tigers with pitches. All are given the Unstable modifier</li>
<li>On Day 32, during the Hades Tigers’ Solar Eclipse game against the Canada Moist Talkers, Moody Cookbook is incinerated in the top of the 3rd inning. The game ticker displays new text not previously seen during other incinerations:<ul>
<li>A Debt was collected. Rogue Umpire incinerated Hades Tigers hitter Moody Cookbook! Replaced by Carmelo Plums. The instability spreads to the Moist Talkers’ Elijah Bates<ul>
<li>NOTE: The phrasing “spreads” is later changed to “chains”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bates is incinerated in the 6th inning, spreading the instability to the Hades Tigers’ Yazmin Mason. Scorpler is incinerated in the 7th inning, spreading the instability to the Canada Moist Talkers’ Anotnio Wallace<ul>
<li>Returned now states that Hotdogfingers has a random chance of being returned to the grave randomly at the end of any given season</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The incinerations continue in the Day 33 game between the two teams (notably, both games were Solar Eclipse games. This is the only weather that incinerations of this nature occur in, despite their differences from normal incinerations). Notably, Kiki Familia (the replacement for Elijah Bates) is incinerated in this game despite not having the Unstable modifier, marking Familia&#39;s as the new record for shortest ILB career at 5.1 innings</li>
<li>Hotdogfingers continues to cause instability/incinerations outside of this event. 12/14 incinerations this season are debt collections</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On Day 63, Jessica Telephone is freed from her peanut during Lots of Birds weather, the ticker stating that the birds pecked her free<ul>
  <li>The Shelled One reappears, simply stating <span style="color:red";>WAIT</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Snackrifice<ul>
<li>The Unlimited Tacos propose a plan to get all 5 of their pitchers shelled by getting them to the top of the idol board - the “ominous red line” now sitting beneath the 10th spot in the ranking rather than the 3rd</li>
<li>After the final game of the season, The Shelled One appears again<ul>
<li><span style="color:red";>WOW / WOWW / WOWWW / SERIOUSLY / WILD / MILD / WILD / MILD / WILD / WOW / YES / THAT IS MORE LIKE IT. / HAVE YOU EVER SEEN SUCH TALENT? / TOP 3 WOULD BE BETTER THOUGH</span><ul>
<li>This appears to be in response to the 3 Peanut-named players finishing in the Top 10 on the idol board. Those players now have the status effect Honey Roasted</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="color:red";>WHAT IS THIS THOUGH? / A SHOW OF UNITY? / YOU WITHHOLD YOUR LABOR? / YOU THINK THAT GIVES YOU POWER? / PITY</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Snackrifice proves a success, leaving all the Tacos’ pitchers Shelled</li>
<li>The Monitor - a giant, floating squid - makes its first appearance after The Shelled One&#39;s message<ul>
<li><span style="color:#5988ff";>who was that / is it an egg / never ate an egg before / where is hotdogfingers / followed hotdogfingers here / from the hall / from the trench / i am gonna watch / see if that egg comes back</span><ul>
<li>All fans are given 10,000 peanuts</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Mexico City Mild Wings take their first championship, and reclaim their original Wild Wings name</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="season-seven-election">Season Seven Election</h3>
<ul>
<li>For the first time, The Monitor appears before election results are released rather than The Shelled One<ul>
<li><span style="color:#5988ff";>that egg come back yet? / wonder what it tastes like /  hey what is that you got there? / tiny eggs? / give em to me / i will make you a deal / wanna see your friends?<ul>
<li>The Hall of Flame appears, listing deceased players and allowing fans to pay tribute to them with peanuts, with the players receiving the most tribute moving up the list. For a time, a dotted blue line appears beneath the 14th slot in the Hall</span><ul>
<li>This leads to speculation that there may be a team of revived players in the future, since there are 14 players per team</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Bless Off decree passes, preventing the top 4 teams of the season from receiving blessings in the current election, these teams being the Baltimore Crabs, the Kansas City Breath Mints, the Charleston Shoe Thieves, and the Breckenridge Jazz Hands</li>
<li>Two more players retreat to the shadows due to blessings. They do not appear in the Hall of Flame, implying that players in the shadows are not dead</li>
<li>The Miami Dale receive the The Iffey Jr. blessing, with Raúl Leal receiving the item. Leal’s stats are minimized, but the team is protected from incinerations</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="season-eight">Season Eight</h2>
<ul>
<li>Jaylen Hotdogfingers’ Debted status effect is changed to Refinanced Debt. Rather than causing the Unstable modifier, Jaylen’s pitches cause the Flickering weekly effect, which causes players to be much more likely to be Feedbacked during Feedback weather</li>
<li>As a result of the Snackrifice, the Unlimited Tacos gain a new pitcher in the form of the Pitching Machine (or PM). PM is subject to the same effects as regular players, including being able to siphon star rankings from other players during Blooddrain weather, which happens twice over the course of the season. It remains on the team even after Sexton Wheerer is pecked free on Day 47. Ironically, PM ends up Shelled after the main season, leaving Wheerer as the only Tacos pitcher</li>
<li>Microphone icons appear beside the 6th, 11th, and 18th places on the idol leaderboard<ul>
<li>At the end of the regular season, Jaylen Hotdogfingers, NaN (Unlimited Tacos), and Sixpack Dogwalker (Hawaii Fridays) occupy these slots after following clues from The Microphone on Twitter (this is theorized to have ties to the flavour text for the Interviews blessing: “The Microphone lifts”). NaN and Dogwalker both gain the Receiver modifier, and all three players gain a permanent Flickering modifier <ul>
<li>After acquiring the Receiver modifier, the Pregame Ritual fields of NaN and Dogwalker’s player pages change rapidly: “hi friends / it is Wyatt / I have a plan”<ul>
<li>“Wyatt” is generally assumed to be the original Wyatt Mason</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After the 32nd game day of the season, the Monitor reappears<ul>
<li><span style="color:#5988ff";>that egg still not back? / shame / you like seeing your friends? / you can see em all you want / just keep those eggs coming / hurry up / this one at a time thing is killing me / shovel em in there</span><ul>
<li>A slider for paying tribute is added, rather than having to pay tribute with peanuts one by one</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On Day 94, a Rogue Umpire attempts to incinerate Dale bitter Beck Whitney. However, due to Raúl Leal’s possession of The Iffey Jr., Whitney survives. Additionally, the incineration is redirected back at the Rogue Umpire, who is incinerated instead</li>
<li>At the end of the regular season, The Shelled One made another appearance to admonish fans for their reaction to the Hall of Flame<ul>
<li><span style="color:red";>IT IS COMPLETE / WAIT / WHAT ARE YOU DOING / I GIVE YOU SNACKS / AND YOU WASTE THEM? / STOP IT AT ONCE / SERIOUSLY / IT IS COMPLETE</span><ul>
<li>Following this message, the Monitor appears again<ul>
<li><span style="color:#5988ff";>hey wait come back / damn / what happened to your friends / are they eggs now? / hmm / still hungry</span><ul>
<li>Theories arise stating that the Monitor may eat Shelled players</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Baltimore Crabs claim their second ILB championship title</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="season-eight-election">Season Eight Election</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Shelled One appears before election results go live<ul>
<li><span style="color:red";>YOU FOOLS / SERIOUSLY? / SERIOUSLY / 100 MILLION SNACKS / WASTED / YOU FOOLS / THAT IS IT / STRIKE FOUR / YOU ARE OUT / SEE YOU SOON</span><ul>
<li>This contact comes shortly after another weeklong siesta is announced</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Wild Cards decree passes, stating that every season from hereon out, a random team from each subleague will leave Partytime to become the 5th playoff team. A best of three Wild Card series will occur on Fridays after the main season concludes</li>
<li>Ron Monstera of the Seattle Garages receives the benefits of the Forever Physical blessing, granting him protection from the Unstable modifier. Monstera is then immediately incinerated anyways due to the New Kid blessing, Monstera being the least idolized player on the team</li>
</ul>
</body>
